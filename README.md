# CollegeProjects

A collection of the large scale projects I have completed while attending Ball State University. The two shown in this README are completely individualized software that was built entirely from the ground up. If you browse some of the other zip files in the repository, you will see some of the smaller projects that had either guided instructions or some sort of formatting to follow.

## Get Together Mobile Application
**Description:**

It's been a little over a year since I've touched this application, so some of the imports are now outdated, causing some problems in the functionality of it. However, it served to be a social messaging app for college students, primarily in computer science. It is hosted through Firebase for the data storage and retrieval. The app features a sign-in page, a customizable profile, a friends list (with your own friend code so you can add people), a home page that displays your most recent messages, and a messaging page where you can send messages to your friends and have it update live. This app was constructed in Android Studio (version information in the zip file README), and uses a combination of Java and Kotlin. This project took place over about half a semester and spanned over three iterations. We also spent time making sure the appearance looks good on the majority of devices offered at the time. As I said, it no longer works entirely as intended, but we did receive an A for the overall grade of the project.

## Free My Financials
**Description:**

This project was a year-long, client-guided software development. Working as a team, we had to meet with our client a couple of times a month to discuss their wants and needs for the software we were developing. The project spanned over 5 iterations, each one introducing a new set of presentable features. At the end of the last iteration, the client informed us that he was very pleased with the result, saying that it was exactly what he was looking for.

**Features:**

### Home Page

This page provides the user with the option of signing in and accessing all of the relevant pages of the software, with a small overview of what they can expect to accomplish on each page.

### Transactions

In the screenshots above, you can see a few test cases between the user adding single transactions, bulk recurring transactions, and the utilization of the search feature to monitor specific categories. The transaction page was designed to be as simple as possible to insert and edit data, without having to directly link bank information (due to client request). The user can add, delete, edit, and parse through transactions with ease.

### Budget

The user can set multiple budgets, as well as track all transactions occurring within that budget. This was a primary request from our client, as he wanted the user to be able to ensure the stability of the cash flow within certain spans of time.

### Calendar

The financial calendar page displays all transaction totals for each day in the month selected. You can see if you're coming out in the negative or positive on each given day, as well as monitor your monthly balance. You can also see if your balance has gone up or down from the previous month, to help keep the user on track of their spending.

### Graphs

The user can visually track their spending through the category pie chart, a bar graph of monthly expenses vs. income, and a line graph displaying the ebb and flow over the course of a month. There is also a section below (not features in screenshot) that displays the budget information, letting you know if you are on track, and how much you have left available in the selected budget.

### Information

This page was a simple one requested by our client. He asked that we host some articles about financial literacy. We did some research and put several articles, along with a brief description of what information the user can expect.
