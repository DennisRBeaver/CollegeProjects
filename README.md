# CollegeProjects

A collection of the large scale projects I have completed while attending Ball State University. The two shown in this README are completely individualized software that was built entirely from the ground up. If you browse some of the other zip files in the repository, you will see some of the smaller projects that had either guided instructions or some sort of formatting to follow.

## Get Together Mobile Application
**Description:**

This project was developed over the course of 3 iterations. It was devloped with the idea that it could be a successful social app for students in the Computer Science curriculum at Ball State. The project features a combination of Java and Kotlin, and employs Firebase for the data storage. At the end of development, we recieved an A for this project, with compliments from our professor for branching out of our comfort zone and learning Kotlin from scratch.

On this page, the user will either create or sign into an account. Upon account creation, they would recieve an automated message asking them to verify their email. If the email address has been verified, the user will be redirected to the home page.

This page retrieves and displays an updated list of your friends, as well as a search bar to navigate to the pages of other users. The page would display in a similar fashion to the profile page below.

This page displays all of your profile information, as well as cutomization boxes that allow you to change them at any time. On this page, you also have access to your friend code. Given the time contraints of this project we figured this would be the optimal way of adding users.

### SMS Page

This is the live chat, where any changes from either party will update on both screens, allowing for real-time messaging.

## Free My Financials
**Description:**

This project was a year-long, client-guided software development. Working as a team, we had to meet with our client a couple of times a month to discuss their wants and needs for the software we were developing. The project languages are split between TypeScript and Vue, with a little Nix in the mix. The project spanned over 5 iterations, each one introducing a new set of presentable features. At the end of the last iteration, the client informed us that he was very pleased with the result, saying that it was exactly what he was looking for. OUr final grade for this project was also an A.

**Features:**

### Home Page

This page provides the user with the option of signing in and accessing all of the relevant pages of the software, with a small overview of what they can expect to accomplish on each page.

### Transactions

In the screenshots above, you can see a few test cases between the user adding single transactions, bulk recurring transactions, and the utilization of the search feature to monitor specific categories. The transaction page was designed to be as simple as possible to insert and edit data, without having to directly link bank information (due to client request). The user can add, delete, edit, and parse through transactions with ease.

### Budget

![Screenshot (24)](https://github.com/DennisRBeaver/CollegeProjects/assets/112116511/187abe1f-00dd-4fbe-988e-3ea543359abc)

The user can set multiple budgets, as well as track all transactions occurring within that budget. This was a primary request from our client, as he wanted the user to be able to ensure the stability of the cash flow within certain spans of time.

### Calendar

The financial calendar page displays all transaction totals for each day in the month selected. You can see if you're coming out in the negative or positive on each given day, as well as monitor your monthly balance. You can also see if your balance has gone up or down from the previous month, to help keep the user on track of their spending.

### Graphs

The user can visually track their spending through the category pie chart, a bar graph of monthly expenses vs. income, and a line graph displaying the ebb and flow over the course of a month. There is also a section below (not features in screenshot) that displays the budget information, letting you know if you are on track, and how much you have left available in the selected budget.

### Information

This page was a simple one requested by our client. He asked that we host some articles about financial literacy. We did some research and put several articles, along with a brief description of what information the user can expect.
